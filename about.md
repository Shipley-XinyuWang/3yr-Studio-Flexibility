This is Shipley XinyuWang, this term's project is a little house or an ADU. And then use these units to create a complex program.

Home is a space that people can complete all activities they need including sleeping, cooking, resting, bathing, etc. which are the basic command of one person. At the same time, home can bring comfortable and safe feeling in one address. Home, a station of soul, bring peace and relaxation in the mind no matter how tired you are outside.
