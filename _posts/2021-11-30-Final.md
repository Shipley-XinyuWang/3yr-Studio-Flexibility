Material/Construction/Assembly:Concrete, GFRP, metal, steel, glass.

Discription:
It is an energy saving complex located in Wellington city, New Zealand. Integrated housing, consumption, community, office, entertainment and other functions. For the society, it offers a solution to local housing shortage, the short distance lack of places to consume. Each building will have a windmill system at the top, while the windmill will be extended further out to sea and into the open Spaces of the city. These windmills can take advantage of the strong annual north and sea winds in the area as a power system for the entire building, while providing a certain amount of pressure relief for the city. Water source heat pump is configured underwater to provide heating for the building in winter and cooling in summer. Reduce the use of air conditioning, save money and electricity at the same time reduce carbon dioxide emissions, it achieves an environmentally friendly building.
As for the support system, the support system of the whole architectural complex is pipe support, which is because both small buildings are supported by pipes. One design supports a house with columns, while the other designs a group of rooms with a column. We combined it, the idea of using columns to support the house, we extended the use of columns, not just to support the house, but to support a group of columns to support a large building. At the same time, a group of columns under the water source heat pump. This allows the support structure to be multi-functional. For the other one, we still retain the function of column, but we make load-bearing more challenging, let a column to bear a group of buildings, realize architectural monization and building growth, use the air area to solve the problem of insufficient houses. At the same time, in consideration of the environmental factors of increasing wind at high altitude, we installed windmills at the top of the pillars to generate electricity from the wind. According to wind analysis and research, wind energy utilization efficiency is the highest when the windmill arrangement is equilateral triangle, so the windmill arrangement is distributed on land and sea according to the triangle.
In order to increase the mobility and growth of the building, we connected the three independent buildings into a whole, and formed a new office and commercial space by connecting them in organic form in the middle, which not only avoided the boredom of skyscrapers but also applied the organic form of the building to the actual function. Finally, we integrate environmental protection, energy saving, organic form and function into the overall structure to achieve an economic and environmentally friendly building.
