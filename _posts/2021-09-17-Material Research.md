##### Why GFRP?

###### High Strength
GFRP has a very high strength to weight ratio
###### Lightweight
Low weights of 2 to 4 lbs. per square foot means faster installation, less structural framing, and lower shipping costs
###### Resistance
Resists salt water, chemicals, and the environment - unaffected by acid rain, salts, and most chemicals
###### Seamless Construction
Domes and cupolas are resined together to form a one-piece, watertight structure
Able to Mold Complex Shapes
Virtually any shape or form can be molded
###### Low Maintenance
Research shows no loss of laminate properties after 30 years
###### Durability
Stromberg GFRP stood up to category 5 hurricane Floyd with no damage, while nearby structures were destroyed
